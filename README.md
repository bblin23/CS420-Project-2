# CS420-Project-2

Rough Description:

N Queens AI Project. Goal is to implement multiple algorithms to solve the N Queens problem when given random board inputs.

The algorithms implemented are Steepest Hill Climbing, Min-Conflicts, and a genetic algorithm implementation. Driver can input options like board size to solve, how many puzzles to solve, and is returned with optional visualization of completed boards for verification, the success rate, and the average time it took to solve each puzzle in milliseconds.

Currently, the genetic algorithm can only handle boards of size < 10 due to lack of foresight when implementing it.
